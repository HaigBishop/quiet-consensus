# White Paper Planning

"describing your problem, contract design, frontend workflow, chosen implementation features, and any future work."

"2–4 pages: problem, design, chosen aspects, future work"


## Highlights:
- "Multi‑contract architecture (e.g. token + marketplace)."
- Viewing Keys?
- 



Whitepaper
Your whitepaper should be a polished, stand‑alone document—clear enough that someone outside our course (e.g. an open‑source reviewer or grant committee) could understand your dApp’s purpose, design, and value.

Title & Abstract
Title that succinctly names your dApp.
Abstract summarizing the problem you solve, your approach, and key results.
Problem Statement & Motivation (≈½ page)
Describe the real‑world issue or user need.
Explain why a decentralized solution is appropriate (trustlessness, censorship‑resistance, privacy).
Related Work & Context (≈½ page)
Brief survey of similar protocols or dApps (e.g. existing token‑gated polls, NFT marketplaces).
Highlight gaps your design fills.
Architecture & Contract Design (1 page)
Diagram showing frontend ↔ contract (and any sub‑modules).
Explain your ExecuteMsg/QueryMsg schema, state layout, and any special features (e.g. privacy).
Discuss security considerations (e.g. access control, edge cases, migration path).
Frontend Workflow & UX (≈¼ page)
Describe key user interactions (wallet connect, transaction flow, error handling).
Implementation Choices & Trade‑Offs (≈¼ page)
Justify 2–3 of your chosen smart‑contract features (e.g. storage data structures, privacy encryption, submessages).
Future Work & Roadmap (≈¼ page)
List at least two realistic extensions (e.g. IBC integration, multi‑contract splits, formal audit, new app features).
References & Citations
Link any standards (CW‑20, CW‑721, SNIP‑20, SNIP-721) or papers you mention.
