# Coding Session Report: SCT Ownership Verification Implementation

## **Objective**
Implement SCT (Soulbound Credential Token) ownership verification in the polling smart contract to ensure only SCT holders can vote.

## **Changes Made**

### **1. Smart Contract Updates (Rust)**

**File: `poll/contract/src/msg.rs`**
- Added `sct_permit: Option<Permit>` parameter to `ExecuteMsg::CastVote`
- Made permit optional to maintain backwards compatibility during development

**File: `poll/contract/src/contract.rs`**
- Updated `try_cast_vote()` function signature to accept `sct_permit: Option<Permit>`
- Completely rewrote `address_owns_sct()` function to implement actual SCT verification:
  - Validates that SCT permit is provided
  - Creates SNIP-721 query structures for cross-contract communication
  - Queries SCT contract using permit-based authentication
  - Parses response to determine token ownership (returns true if user owns any SCTs)
  - Returns appropriate errors for missing permits or failed queries

**File: `poll/contract/Cargo.toml`**
- Initially added `serde_json` dependency, then removed it due to floating-point operation errors
- Final version uses only `cosmwasm_std` serialization to avoid blockchain compatibility issues

### **2. Frontend Updates (TypeScript)**

**File: `web/src/config.ts`**
- Added SCT contract configuration constants:
  - `SCT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`
  - `SCT_CONTRACT_CODE_HASH`

**File: `web/src/secretjs/SecretJsFunctions.ts`**
- Updated `castVote()` function to create and include SCT permits
- Added `getSctPermit()` helper function for SCT permit creation and caching
- Modified vote execution to include SCT permit in the message

### **3. Critical Bug Fix**
**Problem:** Contract failed to instantiate with "floating point operation in module code" error
**Solution:** Removed all `serde_json` usage and replaced with proper `cosmwasm_std` serialization using custom structs

### **4. Documentation Updates**
- Updated polling contract design documentation to explain SCT verification system
- Added deployment instructions including SCT contract requirements
- Updated README with completed features

## **Current Status**
- ✅ Contract compiles and deploys successfully
- ✅ Contract instantiates without errors
- ✅ Frontend integration completed
- ❌ **ISSUE:** Voting functionality fails - likely in the `address_owns_sct()` cross-contract query implementation

## **Key Implementation Details**
- Uses permit-based verification for privacy (no viewing keys required)
- Cross-contract query structure follows SNIP-721 `with_permit.tokens` pattern
- Query expects response format: `{ "token_list": { "tokens": ["token_id1", "token_id2", ...] } }`
- Ownership determined by non-empty tokens array

## **Next Steps for Debugging**
1. Verify SCT contract implements the expected SNIP-721 query interface
2. Test the cross-contract query structure and response format
3. Add logging/debugging to identify where the `address_owns_sct()` function fails
4. Validate permit creation and SCT contract compatibility
